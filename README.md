This is a bot I use in a personal discord group to organize roles, whitelist members onto a personal minecraft server, and has basic command support implemented. (though no useful commands have been implemented. It has support for multiple servers via the settings.json file. In the provided source code is configured for the demo server. Feel free to use this bot for your own personal use. Java 13 is required to build this project.
